                <h2>Another front-end framework?!</h2>
                <p>I have found that I really like many of the front-frameworks out there. I have very rarely used all of a framework and have found it somewhat difficult to just use the parts that I need. That is why I decided to create Assemble.css. It is a collection of front-end components that I use a lot. Some components come from frameworks and some components I created for other projects. Comments in the code give credit to the components I have taken from other individuals/frameworks.</p>
                <p>I have found creating my own front-end frame to be a very rewarding experiance. I have learned a lot and have become more productive on my own projects. I encourage you to roll one of your own. If you like what you see in Assemble.css feel free to use it as is or take what you want for your own framework.</p>
